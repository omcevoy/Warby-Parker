# Warby-Parker

This analysis of Warby-Parker was done as a part of the Data Science Path on Codecademy. The general gist of the problem at hand is that Warby-Parker is an eyewear
company that is attempting to do business in a different way than its competitors. First, the company has its customers take a style quiz to determine which products
they might be interested in. Then Warby-Parker sends the customer a few pairs to try on and ideally, the customer then purchases one of the pairs. Another interesting
aspect of this study is that we are conducting an A/B test, with 50% of the customers receiving 3 pairs to try on with the other 50% receiving 5 pairs, in order to
determine if the number of pairs has an impact on the customers decision to purchase a pair of sunglasses. 

The relevant data for this analysis is spread across 3 tables: quiz, home_try_on, & purchase
